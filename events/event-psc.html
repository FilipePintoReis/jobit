		<h3> Porto Summer of Code </h3>
		<p>
			In just 3 years, Porto Summer of Code has become the biggest tech party in the city of Porto.
			What started as a simple programming competition for students turned into an event for all kinds of builders and hackers, students and workers, designers, programmers, gamers, tech lovers, you name it.
			As the event is starting to grow even more, here at PSC headquarters we think it’s a great opportunity to reinvent ourselves and refocus our goals, starting right now.

			Presenting “Make or Break”.

			Make or Break is the “new” tech event organized by Porto Summer of Code. “New”, because it will have the same core structure as PSC, but with an extra focus on learning and building as a community. You can expect a revamped hackathon, workshops, games, tech presentations, and a whole lot of fun.

			Join us to learn more about Make or Break and to know why we are so excited about this year’s event!

			Be there or be square!
