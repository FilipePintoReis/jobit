		<h3> Glazed Solutions </h3>
		<p>
			"Glazed - Elite Developers" is a team of web and mobile development experts who do custom projects for iOS, Android (both Native and React Native), Frontend (React) and Backend (Rails, Elixir, Node And Django); Having a lot of experience in the areas of Music, IoT, FinTech and Retail.
			We mainly develop projects of high technical demand for the international market, counting among our clients companies like Nestl√©, Fujifilm, Bloomberg, Yellow Pages, Samsung, HP, Vodafone, Telefonica, Rocket internet, SONAE, Louis Vuitton, ASOS and Farfetch.
			Glazed emerged in 2011 from the desire to create a developer-focused software development company.
			Resisting the rapidly growing trend of software teams, Glazed was hiring only the best programmers in Porto, creating a swat team that solves the most complex and technically ambitious projects.
			At Glazed, all other stakeholders, such as project managers, designers, or client managers, exist only to support the programmer by participating only in those projects that really bring value. It is thus a team with the minimum of hierarchy, fundamentalisms, politics and "corporate fat", which allows to offer to the programmers the average of higher salary of the market and great conditions of work.
			But more than material motivations, it's high trust, accountability, and especially being surrounded by interesting people and equally committed to sharing knowledge and doing high-quality work that defines the environment and enables Glazed to retain talent in a very competitive market.
