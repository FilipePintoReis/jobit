I joined Microsoft 14 years ago as a developer in the kernel team for the same product, I led the kernel team for 4 years when we were in charge of all developer experience (compiler, interpreter, debugger etc…) in what was called Dynamics AX. I then moved to the application part of AX leading different teams (Planning, Manufacturing, SCM …). Before joining Microsoft I worked for 10 years in a consulting company in France doing projects mainly in the defense area before moving to Denmark and working 4 years building a compiler and its environment for a Sales Configuration Solution. I’m French from Paris and I relocated to Denmark 20 years ago."
