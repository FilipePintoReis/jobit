<h3>About BOLD International</h3>

<p>BOLD International is a Portuguese company founded in 2009 that operates in the technologies sector.

Currently present in Portugal with offices in Aveiro, Lisbon and Oporto, and in Brazil, in São Paulo. With

around 500 employees, people-centred, BOLD’s teams stand out due to a culture of proximity and

accompaniment.

The company's strategy combines the focus on outsourcing with the development of specialised

competence centres, namely, CARBON for Mobility Solutions; DIAMOND for Digital Strategy; NEOS for

Infrastructure and System Administration; TECHSENYS for Internet of Things; and COLLIDE for

videogames and digital storytelling. Through the cooperation between these specialised units the company

delivers solutions that cover all the needs of a business value chain.

BOLD has been developing different projects for international markets, focusing primarily on North

America, Europe and Latin America. The company has received several awards for their human resources

policies (Award for Excellence at Work, 100 best companies to work for), and in 2015 BOLD joined the

Technology Fast 500 EMEA, ranking third in Portugal. A global turnover of 10.8 million Euros was

registered in 2015, which represents a 35% growth compared to the previous year.</p>
