		<h3> Hostelworld </h3>
		<p>In 1999, a Dublin hostel owner was frustrated with how hard it was to book an affordable place online, and so he started Hostelworld. From that simple beginning it grew across the last 18 years to become the premier way to travel for less and make lifelong friends along the way.
		Today Hostelworld, with offices in Dublin, London, Shanghai, Sydney, South Korea, and opening soon in Porto, is a dynamic and engaging place to work. With a youthful and diverse group of colleagues made up of over 30 different nationalities there’s no shortage of personality, so life here is never dull. We are all about making the world a more accessible place and encourage people to get out there and meet it in person; a philosophy underpinned by our Meet the World brand promise.
		The success of today’s Hostelworld lies in our leading technologies, modern design as well as the passion we have for improving our product for our varied community every single day. We are incredibly proud of what we have achieved, including being officially recognised by the Great Place To Work Institute as a Best Workplace for 2016 and 2017, but we also know that the best and most ambitious part of our journey is yet to come.
