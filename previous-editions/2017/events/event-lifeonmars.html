    <h3>Paulo Köch</h3>

<p>
Paulo is a staunch defender of building cultures of excellence and openness. Permanently discontent with the status quo, he keeps himself sharp with designing software architectures that will always be able to cope with the next feature at the right scale.
As a software engineer at Yelp, he liked keeping teams well oiled and trail blazing their practices, and learning that quirky new tech or way of doing things.
From startups of a handful of people to big SF tech players, Paulo has seen it all, and it's never been enough.</p>
