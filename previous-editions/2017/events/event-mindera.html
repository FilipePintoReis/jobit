		<h3> Mindera </h3>
		<p>

Our culture reflects our lean and self management attitude. We encourage our colleagues to take risks, make decisions, work in a collaborative way and talk to everyone to enhance communication.
We are proud of our work and we love to learn all and everything while navigating through an Agile, Lean and collaborative environment.

		<h3> Pedro Vincente </h3>
		<p> Mobile Craftsman at Mindera, but overall an "improver". What the hell is that? Well, he thrives by (trying until he successfully) improves the processes around him, either “human" or software related. He has been developing mobile apps since 2009, and losing hair almost since then. Loves good talks, code and pranks (if possible at the same time).

		<h3> Ricardo Rodrigues </h3>
		<p id="final">
			Graduate Product Owner at Mindera. Must of all, I love challenges, so after 2 years working in Mindera’s Operations team, I decided to take a new challenge, as a product owner. I love a good environment, a great place to work, to be alway at a place you can call home. For that, I truly believe, one must be an active part of creating better ecosystems.
