    <h3>Laurent Ricci</h3>
    <p id="final">My name is Laurent Ricci, I’m the Group Engineering Manager for the Dynamics 365 for Operations SCM Team based in Copenhagen Denmark. I’m in charge of 50 software engineers building the SCM part of the Microsoft ERP system. I joined Microsoft 13 years ago as a developer in the kernel team for the same product, I led the kernel team for 4 years when we were in charge of all developer experience (compiler, interpreter, debugger etc…) in what was called Dynamics AX. I then moved to the application part of AX leading different teams (Planning, Manufacturing, SCM …). Before joining Microsoft I worked for 10 years in a consulting company in France doing projects mainly in the defense area before moving to Denmark and working 4 years building a compiler and its environment for a Sales Configuration Solution. I’m French from Paris and I relocated to Denmark 20 years ago.</p>
